    <!-- MY CONTENT -->

    <h2>Project 1: Mockup to Website</h2>

      <p><a href="fe-p1/P1-reflections.html">Project 1 Journal</a></p>

      <h3>Intro to HTML and CSS</h3>

        <p>It was a very beginner course and I already had experience of HTML, albeit a long time ago with a different generation of technology. The main thing I got from this was an intro to using bootstrap.</p>

      <h3>Submission: webpage</h3>

        <p><a href="fe-p1/">Copy of the Project 1 page</a>, as submitted and the actually <a href="https://github.com/GeorgePlaten/fe-p1.git">repository</a>.</p>

        <p><a href="fe-p1/resources.html">List of Resources used.</a></p>

        <p>Pretty straight-forward, 0% mismatch on the auto-checker. Annoyingly their render was slightly different to mine, probably because I'm on Windows and they're on OSX or Linux. I was forced to do a good bit of trial and error though their test page, which was of no learning benefit to anyone.</p>

      <p>I didn't bother with the optional extra mockups, though they would have surely have been helpful to give me more experience with Bootstrap and HTML5 / CSS3, I won't lack for exposure to these in the future. I wasn't convinced they were good enough value.</p>

      <h3>Intro to Git and GitHub</h3>

        <p>Version Control I had completed before beginning the Nanodegree course. I got the basics of Git, but for something so simple it does seem very needlessly messy. The 'mindmap' of relationships in Git was not helpful, but the 2 instructors were both great. The reflections exercises were great and prompted me to use a similar style for all learning projects in the future, including this Nanodegree.</p>

        <p>I did not complete the optional extras as it didn't appear to be good value. I have since used a couple of other short Intro courses for Git and GitHub, and still find it awkward. I blame the technology, not the course. I might come back to it, if I find I need anything more than basic ability. Probably go to <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/paths/git">codeschool</a>.</p>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p> -->

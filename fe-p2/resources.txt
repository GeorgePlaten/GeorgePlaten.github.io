        Excellent explanations, need to keep on reference for the other stuff that I haven't encountered yet. (Couple of hairy bits in the middle, but gets better again towards the end.)<br>
        Nice example of how to create module with public methods, but is namespaced (see Public and Private methods) Revisit regularly.

        Seems to be the origin of discussion on hoisting, looks clearly written. Nice example:
        <pre>
          function test() {
            foo(); // TypeError "foo is not a function"
            bar(); // "this will run!"
            var foo = function () { // function operator assigns to
            return statement of local variable 'foo'
              alert("this won't run!");
            }
            function bar() { // function declaration, given the name 'bar'
              alert("this will run!");
            }
          }

// 'loc' clarification on Udacity forums

  This is what I needed, only place I could find it, might need again.

// Google Maps Docs, JavaScript tutorial
https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial
  As usual with Google tutes, it looks a bit crap, but might be worth powering through if and when the specific need arises. Hmmm, a video tutorial, something like lynda.com, might be a quicker way of seeing what's available. In truth, you don't see Google Maps being used for much more that Google Maps...

// THE Data visualisation for JavaScript library
http://d3js.org/
  This is 'the big one' for data vis. Looks complex, but could be great.

// Anonymous Functions # JavaScript on Wikipedia
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_function#JavaScript
  So (function(){}()) and (function(){})(), are pretty much the same thing - anonymous functions that get executed immediatly. They are almost the same as: var f = function(){}; f();
  After that, it's gets a bit silly.

// Helefant on Anonymoud functions
http://helephant.com/2008/08/23/javascript-anonymous-functions/
  var something = function() {
    //some code;
  };
  Is actually an anonymous function assigned directly to the return value of the variable! I never noticed this before! Note: this is also the difference between creating a function with the function delaration and the function operator (the operator is the anonymous one).
  Operators are created at runtime, declarations run before any other code is executed. Note, the function declaration uses the function name in order to add it to the current scope as a variable.
  Revisit this when looking at recursive functions, it builds to a nice example.
  When you give an anonymous function a name, it still only gets created at runtime - therefore giving them names can really help with debugging as all anonymous functions can look the same.
  Goddamn, gotta subscribe to helephant!

// MDN Using dates in JS
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date
  Did this because the guideline suggest using an Interger to represent dates in the education object, but I suspect that's error, although it was a good exercise to do it this way.

        Excellent explanations, need to keep on reference for the other stuff that I haven't encountered yet. (Couple of hairy bits in the middle, but gets better again towards the end.)<br>
        Nice example of how to create module with public methods, but is namespaced (see Public and Private methods) Revisit regularly.

        <a href="http://www.adequatelygood.com/JavaScript-Scoping-and-Hoisting.html">Scope and 'hoisting'</a><br>
        Seems to be the origin of discussion on hoisting, looks clearly written. Nice example:
        <pre>
          function test() {
            foo(); // TypeError "foo is not a function"
            bar(); // "this will run!"
            var foo = function () { // function operator assigns to
            return statement of local variable 'foo'
              alert("this won't run!");
            }
            function bar() { // function declaration, given the name 'bar'
              alert("this will run!");
            }
          }
          test();
        </pre>

        <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial">Google Maps Docs, JavaScript tutorial</a><br>
        As usual with Google docs, it looks a bit crap, but since one of the final projects is about mapping.... Hmmm, a video tutorial, something like lynda.com, might be a quicker way of seeing what's available. In truth, you don't see Google Maps being used for much more that Google Maps...

        This is 'the big one' for data vis. Looks complex, but could be great.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_function#JavaScript">Anonymous Functions # JavaScript on Wikipedia</a><br>
        So <code>(function(){}())</code> and <code>(function(){})()</code>, are pretty much the same thing - anonymous functions that get executed immediately. They are almost the same as: <code>var f = function(){}; f();</code><br>
        After that, it's gets a bit silly.

        <pre>
          var something = function() {
            //some code;
          };
        </pre>
        <p>Is actually an anonymous function assigned directly to the return value of the variable, I never noticed this before! Note: this is also the difference between creating a function with the function declaration and with a function operator in an expression.</p>
        <p>Expressions are created at runtime, declarations run before any other code is executed. Revisit this when looking at recursive functions, it builds to a nice example.</p>
        <p>When you give an function in an expression a name, it still only gets created at runtime - therefore giving them names can really help with debugging as all anonymous functions can look the same.</p>

        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date">MDN Using dates in JS</a><br>
        Did this because the guideline suggest using an Integer to represent dates in the education object, but I suspect that's error, although it was a good exercise to do it this way.

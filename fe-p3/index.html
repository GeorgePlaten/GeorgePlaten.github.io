    <h2>Project 3: Classic Arcade Game Clone</h2>

      <h3>Oject Oriented JavaScript</h3>
        <p><a href="ooj-reflections.html">OOJ Reflections</a></p>

        <p>This was a nice course from a real expert but it was also an ad. I wish Udacity had made their own course. This type teaching breeds a sense of familiarity only, not understanding. It needs exercises and testing. Get the Intro to Github team on this instead!</p>

        <p>On the plus side, he really knows his stuff and I learned a lot. It did have to watch the course 3 times, appropriately spaced. Once making notes, once typing notes and once following along with the code. Thankfully I could do this slowly and at my own pace.</p>

        <p>I did have to work that bit harder by devising my own set of questions and answers for learning, and I would feel very let down by this if I was paying for a course with Hack Reactor and they didn't devise tests, considering the prices they charge.</p>

      <h3>HTML 5 Canvas</h3>

        <p><a href="canvas-reflections.html">HTML 5 Canvas Reflections</a></p>
        <p><a href="canvastypealong.html">HTML 5 Canvas Typealong</a> This includes the working meme-generator and the comments contain more thoughts and details.</p>

        <p>This course really lacked exercises. There were some mini-challenges and on watching the course second-time round after a couple of weeks it seemed much better.</p>

      <h3>Submission: Frogger Clone</h3>

        <p><a href="game/">Mockup of submission</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/GeorgePlaten/fe-p3.git">submitted repository</a>.</p>

        <p>This project was intimidating at first, but taking a long slow look at the code and taking the time try and understand it before beginning was time very well spent. I remembered the advice from LPTHW: go through the code and add comments above every line to try and figure out what is going on. This really worked and helped defeat the fear factor.</p>

        <p>I started off with a list of features and functions added as pseudocode where  I thought I'd need them, and later added a 'milestones' block of comment to keep myself on track. Both of these proved valuable.</p>

        <p>Things that I really got from this project:
          <ul>
            <li>Practice at pseudoclassical patterned classes</li>
            <li>Lots of time in the Chrome Developer Console debugging</li>
            <li>Further exposure to more JavaScript</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>I did a few optional extras for 'Udaciousness', admittedly only a few of those suggested, but I reached the point of diminishing returns in terms of features and went way past in terms of fiddling with the code.</p>

        <h4>Resources</h4>

          <p>Here's a <a href="resources.html">list of resources</a> with comments and live code examples, and there is a stripped down version with just the links as part of the submission package in the <a href="https://github.com/GeorgePlaten/fe-p3.git">submission repository</a>.</p>

    <h2>Online Presence</h2>

      <h3>What are the steps to completion?</h3>

        <p>Reflect on the code review you just completed. What did you learn?</p>
          <p class="follow-up">I really surprise with how well it came together. Sometimes I got stuck into coding and forgot to test or save and was really pleasantly surprised that it almost always worked first time, with each new feature. I think this is down to working with Object oriented code. It keeps everything well organized and simple to follow. Although, it has all grown quite unwieldy now, and I do think if I was revisiting it in a year that it would take me a couple of hours to get back up to speed. I think it would be better if classes were in separate files, game functions in another. All in all there would be a lot of organizational and name related improvements could be made.</p>

        <p>What are you going to do differently on the next project?</p>
          <p class="follow-up">Plan, plan, plan. I'd draw out the logic and file structure on paper first. Pseudocode everywhere. Object oriented everything, as it really seems to lend itself to self-documentation so well.</p>

        <p>Record these reflections in a blog or personal journal for later review. This type of question is very common in the beginning stages of an interview.</p>
          <p class="follow-up">Waaaay ahead of you :)</p>

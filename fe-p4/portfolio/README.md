## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

This is my second run-through of this project, the first was done very
manually and as part of a progressive learning experience. I decided
I would like to redo the project from the start while applying the tools
and techniques I have learned on the first run-through.

In particular, I discovered the concept of using build tools and from 
there I found Google's [Web Starter Kit](https://developers.google.com/web/starter-kit/)
(WSK), which I have decided to use this time.

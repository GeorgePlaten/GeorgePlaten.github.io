		<h2>The Critical Rendering Path</h2>

			<h3>Intros, 1 & 3</h3>
				<p>The goal is to run apps at 60 frames per second, and it's more than
				just JavaScript to think about to get there.</p>
				<p>A demo to help us <em>experience</em> judder and jank, later we'll
				learn to <em>diagnose and solve</em> those issues.</p>

			<h3>Judder</h3>
				<p>A discussion on why judder is bad, how it effects users experiences
				and choices, and how much users care about it (a lot).</p>

			<h3>60 fps</h3>
				<p>Reinforcement that the target for smooth scrolling and other
				animations is 60 fps. Most devices run at 60 fps and people notice
				when a when a frame is skipped.</p>

				<p>This leaves us with 16 milliseconds to render each frame, but as
				the browser has some overheads to take care of, it's more realistic
				to aim for <strong>10 to 12 milliseconds</strong> per frame.</p>

			<h3>What goes into a frame</h3>
				<p>This explains much of the previous course but in summary:
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Parse HTML</strong> in the browser means building the
						DOM</li>
						<li><strong>Recalculate Styles</strong> means build the Render
						Tree</li>
					</ul>
				Note that elements not displayed such as <code>display: none</code> are
				not added to the Render Tree. Also, elements added by CSS such as
				<code>p:after {content: "some text"}</code> <em>will</em> get added to
				the Render Tree.
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Layout</strong> is when the browser calculates the
						sizes and positions of each element in the Render Tree.</li>
						<li><strong>Paint</strong> is the process of rasterizing the
						document to be painted on the screen. This has many sub-steps
						and which can be viewed in Dev Tools, and is very expensive.</li>
						<li><strong>Image Decode</strong> happens inside Paint and is
						the process of decoding and painting bitmaps to screen.</li>
						<li><strong>Composite Layers</strong> is the process of
						handling multiple <em>layers</em>. This can be more efficient than
						painting the whole page to screen at once (especially for pages
						with animations or scrolling objects).</li>
					</ul></p>

				<p>Take Away: Layout Process is complicated and it's always best to
				assume that the entire DOM is always in scope, even though the
				number of <em>nodes</em> effected may be different.</p>

			<h3>Layout and Paint</h3>
				<p>A typical frame pipeline for anything other than a static page
				looks like:</p>

				<p><strong>JavaScript > Style > Layout > Paint > Composite</strong></p>

				<p>The first step (JavaScript, although it could be CSS animation or
				Web Animation API) is any visual changes to the page. And it usually
				triggers all of the next steps to be performed. But we want to avoid
				triggering as a many and as often as possible.</p>

				<p>If you use JavaScript to change a Layout property, such as the
				width of an element, then all the steps will be run.</p>

				<p>If you change a Paint-only property, like font color or
				swapping an image, then the Layout step is skipped.</p>

				<p>The 3rd way to make changes just making Composite changes.
				This can skip both Layout and Paint. Note that skipping Paint
				can be a huge benefit.</p>

			<h3>CSS Triggers</h3>

				<p><a href="http://csstriggers.com/">A list of all CSS triggering
				changes can be found here.</a> Use this to ensure CSS changes
				trigger the least amount of work for the browser as possible.</p>

			<h3>Summary for Part 1: what we learned</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Why we care about hitting 60fps</li>
					<li>What browser work goes into making a frame</li>
					<li>Different property changes have different levels of impact</li>
				</ul>

		<h2>Application Life-cycles</h2>
			<p>Picking and choosing your battles of when to achieve 60 fps (and
			what other targets to have and when to aim for them).</p>

			<h3>RAIL</h3>
				<p>Response - Animation - Idle - Load<br>
				(could also be <em>LIAR</em> in a normal first pageload timeline).</p>

				<ul>
					<li><strong>Load: 1 Second.</strong> Defer anything non-critical
					until after the page has loaded.</li>
					<li><strong>Idle: 50 ms.</strong> Idle time usually comes in chunks
					 of 50 ms which is the ideal time to add more stuff to the page.</li>
					<li><strong>Animate: 10-12 ms.</strong> (60 fps) For scrolling and
					animations.</li>
					<li><strong>Response: 100 ms.</strong> This is the response to
					any user inputs or actions, like clicks or key presses.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>See <a href="https://github.com/udacity/devsummit/blob/master/src/static/scripts/components/card.js">
				FLIP</a> for super-fast animation tricks.</p>

				<p>Remember that both Layout and Paint are severely effected by
				the number of elements that they have to be applied to. There
				is not an unlimited budget, even when code seems to work within
				the target timespan. Here's some budgeting guidelines:</p>

				<img src="img/time-table.jpg" alt="">

		<h2>The Dejudderification Toolbox</h2>
			<p>Chrome Dev Tools - Timeline</p>

			<h3>DevTools</h3>
				<p>A look at the timeline, with flame view,waterfall view 30/60 fps
				lines. Make selections in the frames area on top and use W, A, S and
				D to navigate (also mouse wheel).</p>

				<p>The records are color coded; blue for Parse HTML (which is never
				really a bottleneck). Purple for Recalculate Style and Layout. Green
				for Paint and Composite, and Orange for JavaScipt execution.
				</p>

				<p>In the flame view you can see which records are children of
				other records (on the line directly below) and which records lead
				to others (directly after on the same line).</p>

				<p>The Details pane will show you more information about the
				record you have selected. They're all different depending on the
				type of record. For example JavaScript records will give you a
				link back to the line in the code where the JavaScript was called.
				The details pane can also give more detail about warning and
				errors.</p>

			<h3>Test all the Devices!</h3>
				<p>A timely reminder to test on actual devices because the desktop
				(and the device emulators on desktop) will far out-perform real
				devices and give you a false impression of a non-performant app.</p>

			<h3>Testing Strategies</h3>
				<p>Make sure you're collecting <em>clean</em> data.</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Quit any other apps</li>
					<li>Open an incognito window</li>
					<li>Focus on cause of bottlenecks, not the symptoms</li>
					<li>Measure first, then optimize</li>
				</ol>

			<p>That was basically it, just a deeper dive into DevTools.</p>

		<h2>JavaScript Performance</h2>
			<p>A look at the common causes of jank. Find, fix and test with
			DevTools. Starting with JavaScript.</p>

			<h3>Just In Time (JIT)</h3>
				<p>Because JavaScript is compiled just-in-time, there is no point
				chasing micro-optimizations.</p>

			<h3>Request Animation Frame</h3>
				<p>During animated frames we typically, really only have about 10 ms
				to finish a frame. The JavaScript part can only get 2 to 3 of those
				milliseconds to its thing.</p>

				<p>requestAnimationFrame schedules the JavaScript to run at the
				earliest opportunity of each frame, it also manages how often
				it will be called, to make itself as efficient as possible.</p>

				<p>Older code uses setTimeout() and setInterval(), but this is not
				efficient at all. IE9 doesn't understand rAF, so a <a
				href="https://gist.github.com/paulirish/1579671">polyfill</a> is
				needed for it.</p>

				<p>To use requestAnimationFrame you make a call to it and tell it
				which function you want to call, for example:<pre>
	requestAnimationFrame(someFunc);</pre>
				Inside the function that it calls, at the end, you need recall it
				in the same way again, to schedule the next run. The browser takes
				care of the 'when' and 'how' it should run for you.<pre>
	someFunc() {

		// some code;

		requestAnimationFrame(someFunc);
	}</pre></p>

			<h3>JavaScript Profile</h3>
				<p>The JavaScript profiler in DevTools will display in-depth
				information about what function calls are being made within
				the JavaScript. The profiler should only be turned on on its
				own as the Timeline recording takes a hit when gathering the
				extra information.</p>

			<h3>Web Workers</h3>
				<p>Web workers provide a means to use a different processor thread
				to run separated JavaScript code asynchronously from the main thread.
				This will help prioritize interface updates to make an app or page
				feel responsive and snappy.</p>

				<p>Worker files are downloaded asynchronously and when they fail,
				they fail silently. A new worker is created with the Worker
				constructor function <code>var worker = new Worker('wrkrfile.js')
				</code>.</p>

				<p>Web workers can post and receive messages with the main
				JavaScript thread via an event listener. You can't use the 'window'
				shortcut in a Worker to get the global context, because they don't run
				in the window. You must use 'this' instead. For the same reason, you
				can't do DOM manipulations in a Web Worker.</p>

				<p>Data is sent back and forth via the <code>postMessage()</code>
				method, and is received via the <code>onmessage</code> event
				handler. The message is contained within the Message event's
				<code>.data</code> attribute. (Note that the data is copied rather
				than shared. The <code>postMessage()</code> method can accept
				either a string or a JSON object.</p>

				<p><em>Note that <code>onmessage</code> and <code>postMessage()</code>
				need to be hung off the Worker object when used in the main script
				thread, but not when used in the worker. This is because inside the
				worker, the worker is effectively the global scope.</em></p>

				<p>You can also terminate workers, set them to terminate themselves
				handles errors, spawn sub-workers and import other scripts and
				libraries. You can also spawn SharedWorkers which are a little
				more complex and require a port to opened.</p>

				<p>You can also create 'inline' workers like this: <pre>
	var blob = new Blob([
		"onmessage = function(e) { postMessage('msg from worker'); }"]);

		// Obtain a blob URL reference to our worker 'file'.
		var blobURL = window.URL.createObjectURL(blob);

		var worker = new Worker(blobURL);
		worker.onmessage = function(e) {
			// e.data == 'msg from worker'
	};
	worker.postMessage(); // Start the worker
				</pre></p>

			<h3>Memory Management</h3>
				<p>JavaScript automatically collects garbage while it works. This
				is not in your control, and it's not really possible to predict
				when and where it will happen. To get an indication of what is
				happening, turn on the memory profiler in the Timeline tools.</p>

		<h2>Styles & Layout</h2>
			<p>Note that the number of elements to be styles will effect
			performance on a linear basis. That is, 1000 (same) elements will
			take 10 times longer to calculate than 100.</p>

			<p>Secondly note that, Selector Matching specificity has a vey big impact
			on performance too. Using <a href="https://en.bem.info/">
			Block-Element-Modifier (BEM)</a> naming guidelines is quite good for
			performance.</p>

			<p>But remember, the only way to really tell what matching pattern is
			fastest, is by measuring!</p>

			<h3>Layout Thrashing</h3>
				<p>Layout thrashing is probably the most common issue when styles
				cause bad performance. This will happen when you query an element's
				position, like with <code>element.offSetWidth</code> and then use
				it it to perform a new layout, all inside a loop. Unintuitively,
				using <code>.offSetWidth</code> causes a layout re-calculation on
				it's own, even if you don't change anything. To avoid this, hoist
				such queries of styles out of loops, as the result will probably
				be an invariant.</p>

				<p>This is also called a "Forced Synchronous Layout" by Dev Tools
				and it will be highlighted in the Timeline records for you.</p>

				<p>Remember to check out <a href="http://csstriggers.com">CSS
				Triggers</a> for a list of which CSS properties trigger which
				browser actions.</p>

				<p>The main principle to avoid Forced Synchronous Layout is to
				batch queries and style update together, don't alternate them.
				Also, there's a script out there for batching... in my other
				notes....</p>

				<p>For a concise list of CSS properties that trigger layout
				see <a href="http://gent.ilcore.com/2011/03/how-not-to-trigger-layout-in-webkit.html">
				this post</a> by Mr. Gentilcore.</p>

			<h3>Summary</h3>
				<p>Remember, although we are trying very hard to prevent triggering
				Layout, the main reason not to trigger it, is that is <em>always</em>
				triggers Paint - which is super-expensive when trying to animate at
				60 fps.</p>

				<p>Remember the RAIL budgets: Response 100 ms, Animate 10-12 ms,
				Idle 50 ms, and Load 1000 ms.</p>

		<h2>Painting and Compositing</h2>
			<p>Not all styles are equal, some trigger Layout, Paint and Composite,
			some trigger just Paint and Composite, and a couple only trigger
			Composite.</p>

			<h3>Paint Optimization</h3>
				<p>The Tools: In Dev Tools, you open the console (Esc key), and
				switch to the Paint tab. This tab's pane has a few check-boxes, one
				of which is "Show Paint Rectangles". This paints a semi-opaque
				green rectangle over repaints. During a page scroll, the only thing
				that should be getting repainted is the scroll bar. If the whole
				page is being repainted, then there is a problem to hunt down.</p>

				<p>By turning on Paint in the Timeline profiler you can get an in-
				depth review of all the paint commands that are run during a Paint
				event. This a sub-timeline in the Paint Profiler tab's pane.</p>

			<h3>Compositing</h3>
				<p>Compositing is the act of layering the content to allow overlays
				of different layers to get repainted without effecting the whole
				page. This the same concept as Image and Video editing software.</p>

				<p>In Dev Tools the 2 records associated with Compositing are
				"Update Layer Tree" and "Composite Layers". Update is where Chrome
				calculate how many layers it needs, and Composite is the act of
				putting them on screen. The more layers you have, the more time
				will be spent in layer management.</p>

				<p>Layer management is mostly automatically controlled by the
				browser, but we can force it to generate layers and even better, when
				it is supported by browsers, we can give it hints about what might
				be good places to create layers. <strong>Always check to see
				if and element already has its own layer before creating one for it!
				</strong></p>

				<p>In the console you can check the box "Show Composited Layer
				borders" to see what's going on. Blue lines represent the tiles that
				each layer is split into, and orange lines represent elements
				on their own compositor layers. </p>

				<p>To hint to the browser to give an element its own layer: <code>
				element {will-change: transform;}</code>. <br>
				To force an element onto its own layer (hacky) <code>element
				{transform: translateZ(0);}</code>. Don't put everything on its
				own layer, think carefully where to apply, and test for improvement
				before using. Note this still relies on the hacky method to work
				in all browsers, so it should not be relied on at all.</p>

				<p>More Cool Tools: when you create a Paint profile in the Timeline
				you can also view the number of layers created, and the <em>reason</em>
				each was created. You can also view a 3D representation of the layer
				structure, which is very helpful.</p>

				<p>When you force a layer to be created, you need to be careful
				because it can trigger other elements to become layers too.</p>

				<strong>And that's about it for that course, for now.</strong>
